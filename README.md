-In this project, I aimed to develop a linear regression model to predict the chance of getting an admission for students into a university based on given Dataset.

-Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, etc., along with corresponding admission chances.

Machine Learning LifeCycle:

-Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing features if necessary.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (admission chance).

-Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that contribute significantly to predicting the admission chance.

-Model Building: Utilize linear regression algorithm from Scikit-learn to build a predictive model. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

-Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and visualizations like scatter plots and regression plots.

-Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the model parameters if necessary to improve its performance.

-Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the admission chances for new sets of input data.

-python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

-Jupyter Notebook documenting the step-by-step process along with explanations and visualizations.
